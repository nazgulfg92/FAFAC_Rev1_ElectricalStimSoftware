## App that controls acoustic and electrical stimulation (possibly also wav recording -voc monitoring)

Here's the deal:

This app controls external electrical stimulation into the brain (i.e. I just make triggers) and generates sounds for acoustic stimulation. To test what I wanna test straight on, the electrical stimuli will be generate at a certain rate, and the sounds will be presented afterwards at a given delay from the last electrical stimulation. These delays are set so that I can explore different phases of the rhythm with which I stimulated. Later I can check if the phases at which sounds were presented affect how strongly they're represented in the brain.
